    Fake news is a subject that has been in the news a lot these last few years. You can hear news about political elections being influenced by misinformation. In this day and age people have unparalleled access to information, mostly on the internet.

    On one hand this is a good thing. People have the right to form their own opinions and have access to a sea of information to educate themselves about a subject. On the other hand it can cause suffering as the spread of fake news and misinformation can have serious consequences, including damage to reputations, and the undermining of trust in institutions and the media.

    There are a number of strategies that can be used to combat fake news and misinformation, this includes fact-checking, educating the public about how to identify fake news, and promoting the use of reliable sources. It’s also important to address the underlying causes of the spread of fake news, such as economic incentives for spreading misinformation and the use of algorithms that amplify and spread false or misleading content. By guiding users to correct sources, my innovation may help to mitigate the harmful effects of fake news and misinformation, and contribute to a more informed and trusted online environment.

    According to WHO, people with autism account for 1% of the world’s population. Their communication issues and a different way of processing data from the outside world make it harder to find their own place in society and sometimes make them dependent on the help of relatives and friends.

    YOUROCK aims to help those people train their behaviour and social interactions in specific situations and improve their problem-solving skills in a fun and safe way – through playing the board game with other people. It also gives the neurotypical players a chance to become more aware of and understand better the daily struggle of people with ASD. And finally: YOUROCK creates an open and safe space for everyone to share their ideas and opinions and discuss all matters concerning neurodiversity, in order to take the next step towards a more inclusive society.

    Are YOU ready to ROCK?

    Imagine that you are diagnosed with a mental challenge, let’s say borderline, at the age of 18 and you are seen as unfit for a working environment. Though you don’t feel like you are unfit, you just feel like you need a different way of integration. You want the same chances as your young counterparts, but being a labelled by the government has robbed you of this chance...

    The inter initiative is a service that provides the possibility for young, challenged teens to integrate into working society. Docter’s will redirect the youths to the initiative. The initiative will give them a chance to build a career and the benefits that come with this.

    There they will fill in their interests, excisting skills and dreams. The initiative will school them accordingly but also train the respective companies as well to create a save working environment for both parties. This will enable the youth to grow into a workplace, allow the company fill in the gaps and reduce the money the government infests in funds. By allowing youth to integrate into our society we will create a more sustainable economy and happier youth all together.

    Have you ever had a period in your life where you felt lonely, did not have any close friends, and barely got out of the house? If you have had such a period, you might be surprised there is a name for it: Social disconnectedness.

    Right now, across borders, an estimated 1.8 billion people experience social isolation often, with more than two-thirds being disconnected for more than a year. These long periods of isolation are detrimental to their physical and mental health. People look for support tools, but these are either non-existent, difficult to find, or expensive. Now that is where ReGuild comes in.

    ReGuild is an avant-garde social media app, focusing on building online communities to help the user gain offline socialization skills. The user will check off daily and weekly quests based on a personalised and flexible lifestyle improvement plan. They will be able to share their progress with others around the world who share the same journey. Together with their guilds, they can work on communal goals, share scientific studies, and show off their collectables. Users will be able to safely share their content with their health professionals for an extra boost.

      Have you ever wondered what is out there? Beyond what we can see, or even imagine, lies an ever-expanding universe. Space is the big unknown, which can be frightening and overwhelming when we begin to think about it. However, it can contain and reveal to us answers about many of life’s most challenging questions. The current ways to learn about space can be quite overwhelming and having to learn about 3D concepts in a non-visual way can be quite challenging. With Interstellar VR, teachers would be able to provide students with an interactive, immersive, and fun way of learning about space. Students would be playing a “story-based game” and exploring different VR space environments focusing on various space topics. Integrating this new way of learning would also allow all students to explore STEM subjects at a young age, allowing for more diversity in the field in the future and free exploration. VR learning would allow for all students to explore space, without any of the pressures that comes with the subject and old teaching methods.

    Do you feel stressed? Well, I do. Oh, and did I mention, training 30 hours a week? The constant thought of “oh I have to do this” and “oh I have to do that” really causes stress. When do you know when it is enough and when do you know when to take a break?

    I will be paying attention to how I can create a solution for Topsport athletes struggling to balance their mental and physical health so that they can perform at the highest levels possible. Mental health awareness among athletes is a big problem and I want to tackle this problem with my innovation.

    Imagine a world where all companies you have interacted with, know exactly who you are and what you do. They not only know what you like, but also your weaknesses, like chronic illnesses, mental health and financial standing. They exploit these aspects of you to keep you enslaved to their platforms and to make you keep buying things you might not even want or to influence your decisions on a bigger scale you might imagine.

    It isn’t hard to imagine a world like this, on the contrary, we even live in it right at this moment. Terrifying isn’t it? Our privacy is being intruded without our consent and companies even know more about you than you know about yourself.

    My platform, Transparency, aims to give the consumer more insight in their privacy. When you login, you get confronted with a privacy score based on which apps you have installed and your online behavior. Besides that, you can also quickly check what data apps collect and how private they are.

    To get my target audience to the platform and to make them more aware, I made a card game where the players play as companies and deal with really personal data.

    Are you aware of the invisible killer inside your home?
    Indoor air pollution, the invisible killer, has been ranked as one of the top five public health risks. 4 million people die each year from polluted indoor air.

    That’s why I created atMOSSphere, an air purifier with moss. It cleans the air, reduces the health risk and increases the user’s productivity by enriching the air with oxygen

    atMOSSphere is a moss wall with a fan on the back, which moves the air through it, thus supporting the purification of the air. Through a sensor, the air quality in the room is measured and the user is informed when it becomes too bad. In this way it protects you from diseases like asthma, pneumonia, cancer, allergies and children from serious growth disorders.

    I used moss, because it is an inexpensive material and I want to make the air purifier affordable for many people. Furthermore, moss is a wonder weapon against air pollution, easy to care for and it visually beautifies the interior. That is why we should use athMOSSphere to beat the invisible killer inside our homes now before it is too late.

    Ever wondered what it feels like to step inside the shoes of a person with a different ethnicity, culture and/or skin colour? Ever wondered what their daily lives look like? This is something we simply cannot accomplish in real life. Fortunately, we now live in a digital era where more things are possible.

    How Does It Feel is a virtual reality space where body language is at the focal point of the experience. Body language is only one of many microaggressions that can be harmful: microaggressions can make people feel unsafe, belittled and like they don’t belong. This creates a gap between the ethnic minority and majority groups. Similar to biases, the key is to create empathy to prevent microaggressions from happening.

    Inside this virtual reality experience, you can look at the world through the eyes of the minority group. Individuals that step inside, will experience different levels of harmful body language without them getting any explanation beforehand.

    This experience is not a one- time thing: it’s the start of a journey where biases step forward, while also getting aware of our own biases. Because yes; we all got them.

    As humans, we tend to live either in the past or the future with our minds. We spend so much time thinking about what went wrong yesterday or worrying about our busy schedule tomorrow, scrolling for hours on our phones. These negative thoughts are a great source of suffering, and cause anxiety and stress.

    Long term stress can be very bad for our health, and causes many other diseases. Stress is the number one health concern of high school students.

    MindNow is a mentally healthy space at school, where you can go when you are stressed. Let go of all negative thoughts, focus on what is important NOW.

    This room is a multi-sensory space, to encourage teens to be in the now, and help improve concentration by giving their brains a rest. I’m amazed by the capacity of our brains and body, to change and heal by giving the right stimulus. Using stimulating senses through vision, hearing, smell, touch and interception exercises. These personalized exercises help you listen to your body, by practising being present. With MindNow I want to change the mindset on schools, implement well-being during school days. Enter the room to recharge, relax and manage your stress.

    Most people who live in a big city are familiar with it. Your neighbours are completely unknown to you, at best you know their name by accepting parcels.

SoRooF brings people together who already live close to each other and strengthens the neighbourhood through friendship and helpfulness. It consists of two components: a simple rooftop garden with an outdoor kitchen and an elaborate system of letters with seeds and recipe ideas. These are based on the seasons. SoRooF will bring people in the neighbourhood together to garden, cook and relax, which transcends cultures and connects old and young. It is organized via an easily accessible planner with magnets that can be placed in the hallway. With the help of these magnets, neighbours can see who is growing what and who is actively participating in the garden. When the harvest is due, the neighbours can arrange to cook and eat together in the outdoor kitchen.

    SoRooF is a unique service that makes practical use of unused space and connects people. Let’s meet on the roof!

    Food for Thought is an all- in-one food eco-system that helps medium to high income households in developed countries buy smarter to waste less. It’s a subscription service that includes a meal kit, home delivered groceries and waste collection. Overbuying is one of the main reasons for food waste, so that’s the core of the concept. It comes with a waste bin that makes it easier for people to recycle.

    On the Food for Thought website, users can get their first box, customize it to fit their needs and culture and schedule pick-up and delivery times. With every subscription comes a waste bin. This bin has removable smaller bins for every type of waste. The loose bins will get picked up with the deliveries. The contents of the bins get analyzed every pick-up to see exactly what gets wasted. This information will be used to reduce overbuying with every delivery. With these deliveries come the meal kits and the rest of the groceries. These will eventually all be perfectly portioned and fit the needs of the customer.

    Eventually the developed world would need less food so more of it can stay in the less developed countries to feed people that really need it.

    ‘Green time’ is a modular indoor garden to be placed in city areas too crowded with buildings and little green.

    I aim at providing people with a safe environment to shelter from the hustle of everyday work life. The indoor garden is meant to help people who experience the hustle culture into becoming more present and mindful during their leisure time and make the best out of it.

    Nature’s calming properties will help the stressed and overwhelmed consumers to relax and slow down while acknowledging the powerful impact nature has on the mind. Other characteristics that the garden presents are sound isolation, purer and cleaner air and shelter from the external weather conditions.
    These features will create the most welcoming environment to regenerate the body and the mind.

    The modular garden will be easy to install and thanks to its self- sustaining systems such as solar panels and water harvesting, the only responsibility left would be maintenance.

    Including more green time in one’s daily life has never been easier, no need to change one’s routine or rush to get to the closest park.
    So, now that you know, would you allow yourself some green time?

Following completion of the survey, ReFresh will offer the user tips, advice, and potential solutions for their social media-related issues.

People will be able to filter through the types of content they interact with using ReFresh’s features in a much more personalised way, giving them a more focused and healthy angle on social media. ReFresh aspires to significantly improve the value of the social media experience over what it already offers through customization and taking control.

    Nowadays more and more people need food support. But on the other hand in the EU over 150 million tons of food is wasted every year of which 45% consists of fruits and vegetables and 5% of this is wasted during production. This waste is called Class 2 food and is still edible. Supermarkets don’t want to sell this and food banks often lack volunteers to collect it. Therefore, I searched for a solution to fill the gap in the current food system.

    The Short Food Chain is a service which links the supply of Class 2 food coming from farmers with the demand for Class 2 affordable food by members of the No-Food- Waste Community (NFWC) in the city. NFWC is an empowered community based on the willingness of volunteers. The community uses timely exchange of information on food availability with the Short Food Chain app. Volunteers arrange rides and organize food collection and distribution. For transport, volunteers use buses of partner food aid organizations to deliver the Class 2 food at pick-up points in the city where members come to get their food. At the pick-up point the members and the volunteers use the Short Food Chain Booklet.

    Each year 92 million tonnes of clothing waste are created each year globally. This number is increasing every year. Most of it ends up in landfills or is getting burned. We are consuming a lot of fast fashion, more than ever before. All this consumption is affecting our climate. I wanted to come up with something that reduces clothing overconsumption. That ́s why I came up with my innovation “Upcycle your wardrobe”.

    Upcycle your wardrobe is an interactive card-collecting system that shows you how you can give new life to your old clothes by upcycling them. Now you may be wondering how does it work? I will tell you right now.

    When you go to the supermarket and buy specific items like milk or bread, on the packaging there will be a card. And on this card, there’s a QR code you can scan. When you scan the QR code it will lead you to an upcycling instruction video that shows step-by-step how you can upcycle an old clothing item. It shows you for example how you can make a tote bag out of an old pair of jeans.

   It could be safe to say that many parents are hesitant to buy expensive children’s clothing as they know they will be small in a few months. That is why children’s brands answer this occurrence by creating low- quality clothing that is cheap and easy to produce. Because of the low-quality and easily fleeing interests of children, the newly bought clothes are often thrown away and new ones are bought in their place.

   Sharing ‘n Caring offers a sustainable alternative that would help parents take a step towards a better tomorrow for their children. By encouraging families to consume more responsibly and to donate old belongings of their children to others, we can create a more circular children’s economy.
   
   Parents would be able to swap items that their children are no longer using, through the online platform or in the pop-up store. Parents would be encouraged to include personal storytelling about the history of the items that they are currently giving away.
   
   Clothing is not only something your child would wear and that doll is not only for entertainment. These items would help you and your child create new memories, so let’s continue their adventures with Sharing ‘n Caring.

    More than 27 million toys are thrown away every year. But what happens to these toys? They end up at the dump or worse somewhere in nature. And most of these toys are made from plastic. 

    With my innovation, I not only want to lower this number, but also want to educate young children about plastic waste and all the things they could do with their old toys or other plastic material.

    My innovation is called RE-TOYS, a place where children can come with their friends,  parents or even go on schooltrips. All they need to do is bring their old toys and together we create new ones out of it. They can eigther pick a design they like, or create their own with the staff. Then they put their old toys in the machine and watch the magic happen.

    This innovation is focussed on circularity, is educational, but most of all fun for children and good for nature.

    So are you going to buy some new Lego, Playmobil or toy car? Or are you going to create your own unique toy at RE-TOYS?

    Plastic is almost everywhere in our life. Games, boxes, clothes, food, everything is packed in plastic, now even the oceans are full of plastic. 

    That is what BlueTrade is about, tackling the problem of plastic and finding a solution for preventing plastic trash in our daily food consumption. 

    BlueTrade is a sustainable food delivery service that supports farmers and the local food shops. Everything gets delivered in the most environmentally friendly way possible, by bike or with e-cars for bigger orders. 

    The unique part of BlueTrade is the packaging. The food boxes are bioplastic made from algae. Which makes them completely compostable. It can be composted at home in a garden or collected in a compost bin. The bin would then be given back to the farmers where it gets composted and used as fertilizer.

    Crime in a major problem worldwide. In the Netherlands only, there were already 285.000 cases of burglaries reported in 2021. My innovation therefore focuses on this problem. 

    Holo security is a security system that tries to manipulate the intruders by playing with their emotions. It uses an interactive hologram. The hologram works with artificial intelligence, making it possible for the hologram to interact with the burglar via sound and movement. The system will be activated by motion sensors and cameras. It’s created for companies and organisation that need to protect valuables. 

    It creates the feeling of being watched. The AI-function will analyse what the person is doing and what he is wearing. This will create a personalised message for the intruder. The system will either keep the intruder inside (so the police can come in time) or scare them away, depending on the preference of the company or organisation. 

    Better safe than sorry!

    Project Sora is about bringinga new shoe standard to the world. That focuses on bringing modular shoes with custom parts to people that suffer from limb length discrepancy. It provides these people with a solid option so they can be confident in their choice of shoes.

    The shoe itself contains two parts. The base model (the upper part) is made with a designer in mind, and it will lend itself as an empty canvas to anyone willing to express themselves creatively. 

    The attachment (the bottom part) is a height adjusted one-piece sole, made for the one for that needs a specified custom height. The mechanism on the bottom part of the base makes it possible to hot swap this attachment-sole for whatever situation is needed. 

    Someone would only need to buy a Sora base model and an attachment-sole and with it they would be able to swap out the sole for whatever they need. This also aids sustainability so people will not need to throw away their entire shoe anymore if the sole get damaged. 

    Sora means sky in Japanese, which symbolizes freedom. Project Sora will give freedom to people and let them go wherever they want.

    My innovation is a sensory experience that is focusedin making others feel what Muslim women have to struggle everyday in terms of wearing hijab and being judged for their beliefs. For drawing attention of the exhibition it is necessary to create a performance in a public space that calls the curiosity but does not give many details so people do not go to the exhibition with preconceived ideas.

    The idea is that there are three rooms. In the first room there are a few people that are talking about something that touches the customer (this information is gathered before the experience) and they are rude with the customer invalidating their opinion. The second one is a job interview where the beliefs of the person is taken into account for deciding if the job is suitable or not. With these two rooms there is a negative effect provoked in the person. The third room is a television where it is shown how different Muslim women living their lives and struggling with their daily problems to show that they are not that different from the person who is watching the video and to create empathy. When the video ends the person can express how they felt in the experience and a woman says that that is how she feels everyday.

    The main objective of my project is to solve a big problem in a didactic and fun way, doing activities where the children do not see this subject as just another subject.

    It is the new fun and didactic way to teach the values that a person must have to be a better person. This will help us to learn from children and generate that bond that society must have and to eliminate all the macho acts that can occur from children get to spot.

    It is part of forming a link between education at home and education at school on how to be in harmony and the values necessary for the new generations to lead a life without any type of violence, =be it physical, verbal, or psychological. Emotional, among others, that they learn to identify from a young age that it is necessary to raise their voices when any of these incorrect acts occur in their lives and thus be able to eradicate all kinds of violence.

    Although social needs are one of the basic human needs, many people don’t socialize anymore. Due to the pandemic and the digitalization people feel lonelier than ever. Social isolation and loneliness are estimated to shorten a person’s life expectancy by up to 15 years. I want to do something about this and that’s why I created CityChat.

    It is a socializing place in the public space that invites people to connect and lowers the inhibitions to meet new people. On a big screen you can get communication input in the form of questions and polls on different topics like music, sports and more, that change every day. CityChat provides community building that positively encourages and empowers people, making them feel less lonely and improving their mental health. By making it accessible in the public
    space and for free, it is open to everybody. All answers are stored on a website that you can access by scanning a QR code. There you can also submit new questions and find a map with all CityChats around the world.
    
    Let’s fight against loneliness and start connecting with CityChat.

    Do you know what silence sounds like? If you live in one of Europe’s cities then according to WHO you are probably one of 113 million citizens experiencing serious annoyance during the day caused by noise pollution.

    Our cities are heavily polluted with noise pollution, which affects our physiological health leading to premature cognitive decline. The goal of the project is to spread awareness about noise pollution and measure the problem to make it visible in the form of data, giving to residents the agency to have an impact on urban policy.

    Through a grassroots initiative, the Noise app allows residents to participate in the creation of a noise pollution map. All they need to do is to have the Noise app turned on in the background during their urban walks. Based on this, a map will be constructed, which they can additionally use to choose a route less polluted by noise.

    Part of the project are the chambers of silence located around the city: soundproof booths that allow people to experience, during a session of several minutes, how quiet silence can be.

    There is no denying that a lot of people feel stressed, with some even feeling ‘extreme’ stress. Meanwhile the world is not slowing down for us. My goal is to spread the joy and health benefits, like reducing stress that interacting and surrounding yourself with plants can bring.

    A common problem though is that it’s hard to garden. New gardeners kill about 70% of their plants. This can be quite costly and demotivating.

    To solve this problem I came up with Re-Plant, a plant trading and selling platform from, and for the people. When you succeed in taking care of a plant and manage to get cuttings or germinate a new plant, you can trade it with someone else for a different one. Others who haven’t had such luck can of course also buy them at a lower rate than in stores. When exchanging plants you can even share tips on plant care so that the person who receives it gets a good start.

    This way you can enjoy the benefits of plants in your house with less worries and more knowledge.

    The magic shop is an indoor green space created to help battle seasonal affectiveness disorder and make the colder months more pleasant. Within this space, there are flowers and plants to add to the calming environment and improve mental health.

    Combined with nature, there will also be therapy lights, which will be adjusted to the different times of the day to help create a calming ambience.

    The goal of therapy sessions and calming activities is to help those suffering from SAD to not become “dependant” on this space and learn to deal with the seasonal changes on their own, by taking slow steps and bringing more awareness to the situation.

    This way we can help create our inner eternal sunshine and make it through the harshest winters.

    Have you ever thought about societal taboos and how they limit us in our social nature? Are taboos even created by humans or has this always been there? How can we help kids in creating their own identity?

    These are questions I asked myself these past couple months. For my innovation I looked into the lives of kids between the ages of 4-7 years old, kids who are really finding out who they are, they are creating their own identity, therefore I created the question: ‘How might I empower kids between the ages of 4-7 to have a conversation about societal taboos and how to challenge them in the future?’

    I created my innovation PERSPECTIVE. My innovation creates conversation between kids and bridges the gaps between context to create a new context. PERSPECTIVE educates kids about their own identity in a playful way using a physical innovation which involves roleplaying. This lets kids experience their true self and helps them understand and identify themselves in the future.

    Interested already, take a look at my new perspective!

    Every day 33 people die of heart disease due to ambulance delays, only in the UK.

    In 2020, 180 people died in car crashes involving emergency vehicles, only in the USA.

    The way we alert passers-by to emergency vehicles is outdated. This needs to change.

    Road Alert is a system that warns you when an emergency vehicle is coming your way. It not only provides you with this fact but also informs you where the car is coming from, which route it is going to take and what you should ideally do.

    The technology that I will use to achieve this is by having the emergency vehicle turn off the radio of the surrounding vehicles and provide them with the necessary information both visually and through audio.

    The goal is that every motorist who is on the route gets informed about 15 to 20 seconds before the emergency car arrives so that they have enough time to react and the ambulance etc. can drive past them without any major inconvenience.
